# Contributing

## Git Workflow

Refer the [GiHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) rules for more details, but in short:

- Always create the changes in a feature branch, using a descriptive name for the change
- Provide a short but descriptive message in your commits, they will be all squashed into one once the branch gets merged
- *Never* push to master or develop
- Update your local development branch with `git pull --rebase origin develop`
- Always provide unit tests for your changes if applicable
